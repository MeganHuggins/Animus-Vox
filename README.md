## Animus Vox
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Animus Vox is an app that allows the user for them to tell how they are currently feeling. From there they will be meet with the option to either find music that continues with their current mood or go an opposite direction. For example, if the user states that they are currently feeling sad will be given the option to find 'sad' or emotional songs (because sometimes all we want to do when you're sad is listen to ad songs and cry and dance!) they are also given the option to find 'happy' music first off. The opposite mood choice is made itinially for the user but they have the opition to change the option mood at anytime while on the Opposite Page. Once a user selects which direction they want to go, music wise, they will be redirected to a playlist that is pulled down from the Openwhyd API. 

### Learning Goals
1. Demonstrate the mastery of the following technologies:
    - React
    - Testing-Library/React
    - Router
    - Asynchronous JavaScript
2. Work within constraints to deliver a unique product for your audience which helps them in some way. Your project must utilize your assigned API and technology, and must be built for your assigned audience.
3. Your applications should have the following core functionality:
Display the data from the API in a way that applies directly to your audience
Create a one of kind of App in React within the time frame as a solo project
